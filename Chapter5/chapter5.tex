\chapter{LIWC/text transformation chapter}\label{chap:liwc}

\zw{Describe problem field}
One of the key issues in machine learning for content moderation is that such systems both in deployed settings (see \autoref{chap:filter}) and in research (see \autoref{chap:intro} and \autoref{chap:nlp}) over-fit to individual tokens that see over-representation in the positive and negative classes respectively. While research efforts have been made to address such issues \cite{CITE: cite papers that try to address overfitting}, the problem of over-fitting to words and identity markers remain an open question for the field. While some such approaches have addressed this problem by replacing certain words and phrases with more general tokens \cite{CITE: Replacing token papers} or masking \cite{CITE: Masking token paper} tokens. Other work has attempted to address the problem by treating it as a problem of dataset bias \cite{CITE: Bias papers}. Here we instead we propose a different approach which serves multiple purposes of 1) minimising the vocabulary to avoid over-fitting to distributional skews in vocabulary across classes; 2) representing documents in terms of how they represent thoughts, feelings, personality, and motivations \cite{LIWC:2015}; and 3) returning modelling of hate speech and different forms of abuse to simpler dictionary-lookup methods that simplify modelling of abuse to how words are used, rather than focusing on their surface forms, to achieve similar performance as compared to more complex models.

Through the use of LIWC, we transform documents from large vocabularies, that are riddled with typos, spelling mistakes, and obfuscations to the functions how these words are used. As seen in \autoref{fig:liwc_transform}, the transformation of words to LIWC categories both contain deeper information about how words are used, and encode a loss of information in words that do not exist in the LIWC dictionary. However, by radically reducing the sizes of vocabularies, from several thousand unique tokens to around 1000 unique tokens that provide deeper insights than simply selecting the most frequent tokens. Moreover we show that the strength of the classification performances within the dataset will translate to other datasets, as these transformed tokens are more general than their surface form.

Focusing our attentions on simple deep neural networks and shallow models, we show that by radically reducing the vocabulary size, while increasing the contextual information of the remaining vocabulary, we can achieve strong classification performances within datasets and more importantly, on out of domain datasets.

\zw{Describe the datasets here, along with collection rationales, data sources, annotation guidelines, etc.}

\section{Modelling}
\zw{Describe the models and experimental settings}

For all models that use surface level representations, we pre-process the documents using the 200 dimensional Byte-pair encoding \cite{CITE: BPE paper} for two reasons. First, to minimise the number out-of-vocabulary tokens and second to limit the number of unique tokens. 

For all models we define and search the parameter space for the optimal parameters for each model.

We do not restrict the input vocabulary for any of the neural models.

\subsection{Neural Models}\ref{sec:liwc_neural}

We implement and train four different model architectures with two variations each, resulting in a total of 8 different neural models for each input representation. We choose to train a Multi-Layered Perceptron, a Recurrent Neural Network, a Long-Short Term Memory network, and a Convolutional Neural Network. We choose these four models as they have each been used in previous work \cite{CITE: Find papers with Neural approaches for each of the models}. Each of the four models are trained with either a linear input layer and an embedding input layer. We choose to make this distinction as our datasets are too small to meaningfully learn embedding layers, yet for the LIWC transformed documents, pre-trained embeddings have little value, as all tokens would be out-of-vocabulary. Thus to compare comparable entities, we train a model with each type of input layer. This difference in the input layers however also implies a difference in how each document is represented: for the models with linear input layers, each document is encoded as a onehot tensor whereas the models that use an embedding layer as it's input layer the documents are represented as index-encoded tensors (please see \autoref{fig:onehot_embedding} for an illustration).

In order to focus on the utility of the transformed document representations, we use bare bones models with simple architectures. To address the issue of the models over-fitting to the data either by identifying spurious correlations or by over-training the model, we subject each model to dropout and early stopping criteria (please see \autoref{sec:dropoutearly} for more details on the functionality of early stopping and dropout).

We perform Bayesian Hyper Parameter Tuning using the Optuna library \cite{CITE: Optuna} to identify the optimal parameters for each model and the variants of each model. We also investigate the influence of batch sizes and learning rate. For more in depth explanation of how each model works, please refer to \autoref{chap:nlp}.

\subsubsection{Multi-Layered Perceptron}

The first neural model that we use, is a Multi-Layered Perceptron. We choose the model as it is a simple neural network, that can act as a minimal setting of the usefulness of neural networks. Our Multi-Layered Perceptron consists of either a linear input layer or an embedding input layer. The obtained representation of a batch of documents are then passed on to a linear hidden layer and passed on to a linear output layer, which is subject to a softmax layer computing probability estimates for each class. Following the first and second layer of the model architecture, we subject the output of the layer to a non-linear activation function and a dropout layer. The model architecture is depicted in \autoref{fig:liwc_mlp}. For the Multi-Layered Perceptron models, we search over the following values:

\zw{INSERT: Double check values.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dropout strength: $[0.0, 0.1, 0.2]$, \zw{Double check it's referred to as "Strength"}
  \item the hidden layer dimension: $[128, 256]$, and
  \item the activation function: $[tanh, relu]$
\end{itemize}

For the models that use an embedding layer as their input layers, we additionally search for the dimension of the embedding layer, allowing the model to search between $[64, 128, 300]$. For the linear input layer model, the hidden dimension search functionally replaces the search over the embedding size.

\subsubsection{Recurrent Neural Network}

The second neural model we implement a Recurrent Neural Network; we choose this model as it offers improvements over Multi-Layered Perceptron due to the introduction of the recurrence over the tokens in the documents (see \autoref{chap:nlp} for more detail). Our Recurrent Neural Network consists of an input layer, which can be a linear layer or an embedding layer, a recurrent neural network layer, a linear output layer, a dropout layer, and a softmax layer to compute the probabilities of each class. The recurrent neural network layer is provided an activation function, which is applied within the layer.

The model is trained by first passing batches of index or onehot encoded documents through the input layer, and are passed on to the recurrent neural network layer.\footnote{We use the PyTorch implementation of the Recurrent Neural Network layer.} The resulting representation is then subject to a dropout layer before it subject to a linear layer that maps to the number of output classes. Finally, the softmax layer computes the probability estimates for each class. See \autoref{fig:liwc_rnn} for a depiction of the models.

For the Recurrent Neural Networks, we perform a hyper-parameter tuning over the following parameters and values:

\zw{INSERT: Insert the values.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dropout strength: $[0.0, 0.1, 0.2]$, \zw{Double check it's referred to as "Strength"}
  \item the hidden layer dimension: $[128, 256]$,
  \item the activation function: $[tanh, relu]$,
  \item Embedding size  For the embedding-based models: $[]$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Long-Short Term Memory}

The Long-Short Term Memory network that we implement, consists of an input layer, that similarly to the RNN and MLP can be either a linear layer or an embedding layer; a one-directional Long-Short Term Memory network layer;\footnote{We use the PyTorch implementation of the Long-Short Term Memory Network layer.} an output layer; a dropout layer; and a softmax layer to compute the probabilities. The implementation of the Long-Short Term Memory layer is such that it always uses \textit{tanh} as its non-linear activation function. We use Long-Short Term Memory networks due to their prior successes in other works \cite{CITE: LSTM papers} and because they present a development over RNNs, in that they identify information to ``forget'' in to address the issue of long-range dependencies that occur (please see \autoref{chap:nlp} for more detail).

The model is trained by passing batches of documents through the input layer prior to feeding them into the Long-Short Term Memory network layer. The output of the Long-Short Term Memory network layer is then subject to the dropout layer, before the output layer maps down to the number of label classes. Finally, the softmax layer is used to obtain an estimation of the probability distributions for each class.

For these models, our hyper-parameter tuning considers the following parameters and values:

\zw{INSERT: Insert the values.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dropout strength: $[0.0, 0.1, 0.2]$, \zw{Double check it's referred to as "Strength"}
  \item the hidden layer dimension: $[128, 256]$,
  \item Embedding size  For the embedding-based models: $[]$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Network}

For our final neural model type, we use a Convolutional Neural Network. We select this model as it has been applied previously in academic research \cite{CITE: CNN papers} and in industry (e.g. the Perspective API\foontnote{https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi}). Similarly to the previous model types, the input layer of the Convolutional Neural Network models can either be an embedding layer or a linear layer. The second layer of the model is a two-dimensional convolutional layer. Finally, there is an output layer and a softmax layer. 

For these models, we only consider the activation function and embedding dimension in our hyper-parameter tuning.

\subsection{Baseline Models}

We develop several different baseline methods to compare our method with. For each shallow baseline model (i.e. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines and so on), we train two different types: a surface-token based model that uses the surface forms of the documents (e.g. words), and a LIWC based model. For each of these models, we represent each document for training and classification as \zw{INSERT: vectorisation type} after removing stop words. In addition to the aforementioned models, we also train deep neural networks that similarly rely on surface forms. Specifically, we use the models described in \autoref{sec:liwc_neural} providing surface level tokens as the input to the models.

\subsection{Datasets}
Beyond the different specific models and types of input layer, the datasets themselves also differ strongly from one another across a number of attributes: the various sizes of the datasets, the platforms the datasets have been sampled from, the annotator selection, the annotation guidelines, and the aims of the datasets. As we seek to build generalisable models and compare the performance across datasets, we reduce the classification task in each dataset to a binary `abuse/not-abuse' class, as each dataset addresses different aspects and notions of abuse. We select the Twitter dataset collected by \citet{Davidson:2017} and the Wikipedia Talk pages dataset sampled by \citet{Wulczyn:2017} as our datasets, in part due to the sizes of the datasets and in part due to the different breadth of communicative styles, we select \citet{Davidson:2017} and \citet{Wulczyn:2017} as our training data. To estimate cross-dataset performance, we evaluate our models on \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016}, \citet{Waseem:2016}, and \citet{Garcia:2019}.


\subsubsection{Dataset and Platform Affordances}

As the datasets differ quite significantly in the sizes of the raw number of documents as well as the vocabulary sizes. Moreover, as the datasets are selected from different websites with different communities, purposes, and means of interaction; the data sampled from each platform may differ in content as well as style. Considering for instance \citet{Waseem:2016}, this dataset was collected on Twitter while the maximum length of a tweet was $140$ characters. Documents are thus short as they are given an upper limit on the number of characters. On the other hand, \citet{Wulczyn:2017} collected their data from the Wikipedia Editor Talk pages, where comments are not limited by length. Additionally, these two domains differ in that conversations on Twitter may have no particular topic, conversations on Wikipedia Talk pages always refer back to a specific topic and the conversation of how to address a particular edit to a page. Finally, given Wikipedia's ongoing issues with recruiting diverse editors \cite{CITE: Wikipedia editors issue} and Twitter's comparatively broad user base \cite{CITE: Twitter userbase by demographic ref}, both dialectal and socio-cultural topics and patterns of speech may differ.

\section{Experimental Models}

To evaluate which training dataset allows for better generalisation, we train our four models described in \autoref{sec:liwc_neural} and their variations on each of our training dataset, resulting in $16$ different models trained.

In our efforts to robustly identify models

We experiment using four different models

We retain only the correct spelling, designating all words that do not cohere to the forms found in the LIWC dictionary as unknown tokens.

\section{Results}

While the onehot and index encoded tensors should functionally be equal to one another, we see a direct influence of the input layers on the classification scores; with all models showing stronger performance using linear input layers. We propose that the reason for such discrepancies lie in the simpler training procedure of linear layers which don't seek to find relationships between different tokens but instead simply provide a linear function, and embedding layers that seek to identify the relationships between each all tokens in the dataset.

\section{Conclusions and future work}

\zw{Some concluding remarks}
While functionally this limits the vocabulary, there is also loss of information. Future work, could then employ both simple and complex mappings of different forms of words to single tokens that cohere with the LIWC dictionary, thus limiting information loss while retaining the predictive power.
