\chapter{LIWC/text transformation chapter}\label{chap:liwc}

One of the key issues in machine learning for content moderation is that such systems both in deployed settings (see \cref{chap:filter}) and in research (see \cref{chap:intro} and \cref{chap:nlp}) over-fit to individual tokens that see over-representation in the positive and negative classes respectively. While research efforts have been made to address such issues \cite{CITE: cite papers that try to address overfitting}, the problem of over-fitting to words and identity markers remain an open question for the field. While some such approaches have addressed this problem by replacing certain words and phrases with more general tokens \cite{CITE: Replacing token papers} or masking \cite{CITE: Masking token paper} tokens. Other work has attempted to address the problem by treating it as a problem of dataset bias \cite{Dixon:2018}. Here, I propose a different approach which serves to address the issue of models over-fitting to tokens by 1) minimising the vocabulary in order to avoid over-fitting to distributional skews of low-frequency tokens across classes; 2) representing documents in terms of how they represent thoughts, feelings, and personality; and 3) through such vocabulary minimisation highlight the importance of how words are used rather than their surface forms while retaining model performance. An additional benefit of such vocabulary reduction is a proportional reduction in model size and training time for complex models such as neural networks, resulting in models that have a smaller environmental impact \citep{Strubell:2019}.

Through the use of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary \cite{LIWC:2015,Original LIWC Citation}, I pre-process documents from large vocabularies, that are riddled with obfuscations and intentionally and unintentionally misspelled words into a smaller vocabulary set representing instead psycholinguistic properties of words. Through a reduction of thousands, or in some cases hundreds of thousands, of unique tokens to hundreds of LIWC categories, I aim for models to gain deeper insight into language patterns of abuse than simply selecting the most frequently used tokens. Moreover, I show that such a reduction is accompanied by a negligible intra and inter dataset performance in comparison to models using the full surface-token vocabularies.

\zw{Double check the reduction numbers}
Through the use of simple deep neural networks and `shallow' linear models, I show that through reducing the vocabulary sizes by up to $99\%$ and the number of model parameters by up to $99\%$, while increasing the depth of the information in the remaining vocabulary, it is possible to achieve comparable performances within datasets and mild improvements on out-of-domain datasets. This holds two strong implications for future research on computational hate speech detection: first that current approaches through an over-reliance on surface forms are computationally inefficient, and second that the exclusive use of surface forms of tokens can lead models to overly attend to the occurrence of certain tokens and variations (e.g. prominent misspellings) \citep{Rottger:2021}. Finally, as datasets for hate speech detection frequently contain biases along racialised and dialectal lines \citep{Waseem:2018,Davidson:2019}, the use of LIWC can serve as small aid in avoiding such biases as dialectal spellings of words are likely to not appear in the dictionary, thus being relegated to unknown tokens (see \cref{tab:liwc_tok} for synthetic examples of LIWC representations). Thus, this chapter seeks to provide answers to the following research questions:

\section{Previous work}

In the interest of curtailing the spread of online abuse, a large number of technical approaches have been considered in the ever-increasing body of research on the topic (please see \cref{sec:nlp} for a broad overview on the topic). Here, I focus on three different strands of research. First, I briefly introduce the LIWC dictionary. Second, I consider manual development of features for machine learning models as it is necessary to form hypotheses for what might may serve as indicators of abuse on the basis of the dataset and problem in question. Third, I examine neural network approaches for abusive language detection. Finally, I consider the growing body of research devoted to examining the generalisability of computational models for abusive language detection. I restrict my attention to studies in conducted on abuse in English as it is most pertinent to this work.

\subsection{Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count}

The Linguistic Inquire and Word Count dictionary and software was initially developed by \citet{Pennebaker:2001} in an effort to address the issue of high disagreement and negative effects on well-being of judges, as they reviewed essays written on people's experiences of emotional upheaval. In order to minimise such costs, \citet{Pennebaker:2001} turned to computationally counting words that were in $80$ ``psychology-relevant categories'' in order to gain an understanding of the emotional states and cognition of the authors at the time of writing. By passing over a large body of text within a single document, e.g. personal essays, the \citet{Pennebaker:2001} compute how percentage occurrence of each invoked category. While there are some examples that appear clear cut, e.g. the categorisation of articles such as `a' and `the',
% TODO review footnote
\footnote{Though the categorisation of word classes may seem trivial, however which class a word is categorised into depends on the linguistic theory that a given classification is based on \cite{CITE: Wait for Adina}.}
other word classes, such as ``emotion word categories'' are more clearly subjective and require deeper human consideration \citep{Tauscik:2010}.
Though LIWC was initially developed using long form texts, the version of the dictionary that I use in this dissertation is an expanded version that also used Twitter and ``blogs'' in the development of the dictionary \citep{Pennebaker:2015}. As such, though not originally intended for the use on short-form messages, LIWC has evolved with the rise of new forms of communication in efforts for the dictionary to accurately reflect language use in short-form documents.\vspace{5mm}

In this thesis, I utilise LIWC to provide the word categories that each word invokes, and rather than compute the overall word classes exhibited in a document, I use the LIWC categories of each word in a document as an alternative representation of the document from which percentages of word categories invoked can be recovered. Thus, my approach diverges slightly in the goals of using LIWC, however it does not diverge in the method for obtaining information about the psychological state of the author.

\subsection{Modelling}
\subsubsection{Manually Crafted Features}

A large body of work has sought to use manually developed features for online abuse detection \citep{Davidson:2017,Waseem:2017,Ibrohim:2019,Vega:2019,Wiegand:2018,Tian:2020,Kumar:2019,Fortuna:2018}, showing performance boosts from using manually developed features such as the predicted author gender \citep{Waseem-Hovy:2016} or Part-of-Speech (POS) tags \citep{Davidson:2017}. The primary reasons for using manually crafted features is two-fold: First, by using manually crafted features it is necessary to have some understanding of the data at hand and some intuition about which features may distinguish the classes from the data from one another. Second, as manual features are frequently used with models that don't use neural architecture, they allow for interpretable machine learning models, in the sense that one can often identify how each token contributed towards a final prediction. Moreover, as features are often computationally fast to compute, the use of features along with their expressive interpretability, allow for quickly testing hypothesis surrounding online abuse and its nature.
Considering a handful of systems that use some of the most frequently used features for the development of automated systems for detecting various forms of online abuse, distinct modelling choices, features and rationales for their use become prominent. Here I provide a brief overview of prominent features; how they are used, including which models and feature weighting schemes they are used with; and the explicit and implicit rationales for the use of each feature.

First, the most common feature used, and rarely used on its own, is a Bag-of-Words (BoW) \citep{Fortuna:2018,Davidson:2017}, where each token in a document is treated as independent from the remainder of the document. The use of this feature frequently relies on the use of stop-word lists to remove tokens that are bound to occur frequently across a majority of documents, such as determiners, to avoid models from learning spurious correlations with such words and an individual class due to fluctuations in the data. The understanding of abuse that underlies this feature, is that the occurrence of some tokens are likely to disproportionately occur in abusive contexts, and that those tokens, in isolation, will indicate abuse. Several works have complicated this notion \citep[e.g.]{Waseem:2018,Davidson:2019}, arguing that tokens, in isolation, do not provide the necessary context to determine whether a text is abusive and due to certain perspectives on abuse being overly represented \citep{Waseem:2016} in annotation guidelines and annotations, some words that have been reclaimed, and thus have an innocuous usage potentially in addition to an abusive use, may be disproportionately represented in the positive classes.

To address the issue of token independence, several approaches use n-grams, often bi-grams \citep{Waseem:2016} and tri-grams \citep{Davidson:2017} to aid with identifying abuse. Here, by considering groups of sequential token occurrences independently from one another, a step is taken away from the independence of individual tokens, instead to the independence of short sequences of tokens. Due to this remaining independence assumption, similar issues arise to the limitations of BoW hold for n-grams.

POS tags have also seen frequent use in abusive language detection tasks \citep{Fortuna:2018} and are often used as n-grams. The intuition behind the use of POS tags for abuse detection is that abuse may differ from non-abuse in terms of linguistic structure. While n-grams of POS tags with an independence assumption may not reveal the full depth of the linguistic syntax available through POS tagged data (in contrast to the POS tags of the entire sequence being treated as a single feature), it does relay \textit{some} information on the linguistic structure which has been proven helpful for predicting abuse \citep{Fortuna:2018}.

Another frequently used feature is sentiment analysis \citep{Fortuna:2018} with the underlying assumption that abuse and negative sentiment are correlated, and can thus aid in detecting some forms of abuse. Similarly to BoW and n-grams, this is a feature that is most frequently used in combination with other features as sentiment alone is not presumed to be a good predictor of abuse \citep{Fortuna:2018}. Sentiment as a feature, like the use of LIWC proposed in this dissertation, assumes that some higher level reasoning about the data can be helpful to automatically detecting abuse. Specifically, its use suggests that there the concepts of negativity and hostility towards entities will be relevant to detecting abuse in texts. Notably, some previous work that uses sentiment as a feature for abuse detection \citep{Davidson:2017} relies on previously built systems for detecting sentiment. An implication of using previously trained systems for computing sentiment, rather than assuming that sentiment can be extrapolated only from the dataset, is that sentiment and abuse, while correlated are not equated and thus that the task of detecting sentiment, while related is a distinct task from detecting abuse. As such, a sentiment and abuse are tasks that in some cases co-constitute each other while there may be no correlation in other cases.

Finally, LIWC has previously been proposed as a feature for the classification of abuse in a small number of studies \citep{Nina-Alcocer:2019,Joksimovic:2019}. In these studies, LIWC has been used in conjunction with other features such as lexical features (e.g. word n-grams) and syntactic features (e.g. POS tags) \citep{Joksimovic:2019}. This use of LIWC, similar to the motivations for its use in this chapter, relies on an assumption that the mental states of the speaker and the interpretations of readers will relay information on the intention of the speaker to cause offence. For instance, \citet{Nina-Alcocer:2019} compute the percentages of emotions that are expressed in abusive documents in efforts to identify correlations between impassioned speech and abuse, asserting an intuition that abusive speech is likely to occur in individual moments dominated by emotion rather than rationality. A position that \citep{Waseem:2016} argue is likely as they find that considering the top $100$ most frequently occurring tokens, ranked using Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), does not aid in the prediction of hate speech, suggesting that in many cases it may be a question of moments of abuse rather than consistently abusive people.

All features must be weighted, either through raw counts or their relative frequency. One such frequently used weighting scheme is TF-IDF which weights features by their relative frequency in the corpus \citep{Fortuna:2018}, assigning higher weight to the features that are rare corpus-wide and lower weights to those that common. As such, TF-IDF can be a useful measure to address the dominance of high-frequency tokens. At the same time, TF-IDF also increases the capacity for models to overfit to the corpus and generalise poorly, as tokens that are unique to a corpus may not exist in other data or even be common to other data. The use of n-grams as features provides a similar double-edged benefit, where models learn sequences of words, in abuse detection the most common n-grams are unigrams, bi-grams, and trigrams. Such word-sequences can be helpful for models in uncovering patterns of language use in the corpus but are also sensitive to the vocabulary changes that occur across datasets. For instance \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016} train a Logistic Regression classifier and identify that character n-grams of innocuous words such as `Islam' and `Muslim' rank as some of the most predictive features due to the disproportionate occurrences of such terms in the hateful classes.

Many of the previously mentioned works use similar machine learning models, with a particular dominance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (please see \cref{chap:nlp} for more detail). One notable exception to this is the work of \citet{Gorrell:2018}. In this work, the authors use a ``set of NLP tools, combining them into a semantic pipeline'' \citep[pp. 601]{Gorrell:2018}. Rather than using supervised classification techniques, a rule-based systems was developed to detect abuse that they argue allows for a interpretable and easy to modify method to address weaknesses of the approach without the need for additional large quantities of data.\footnote{This detail on the rule-based nature of the classification systems was provided by Genevieve Gorrell in personal communications.} However, this approach is a laborious one as it requires the researchers to manually identify patterns of abuse and construct rules that can address such patterns along with any exceptions to the patterns that are not abusive.
\vspace{5mm}

In this chapter, we take inspiration from the use of manually crafted features as a way to provide testable hypothesis while departing from the notion of feature generation. Specifically, we hypothesise that LIWC categories can provide deep information for predictive modelling that can allow for high performance in spite of token sparsity when using neural network methods.

\subsubsection{Neural Networks}\label{sec:liwc_nn}
Though the earliest models for the tasks were predominately linear models that used manually generated features \citep{Waseem-Hovy:2016,Davidson:2017,Warner:2012} more recent work has been dominated by the development of neural network based models for automated abuse detection, posting ever-evolving State-of-the-Art models and classification performances \citep[e.g.]{Park:2017,Badjatiya:2017,Zimmerman:2018,Stoop:2019,Isaksen:2020}. Here I consider a handful of neural network methods for detecting abuse, focusing on the distinct implications following the modelling choices and the logics that underpin them. As all neural network based methods that I examine receive only the text as input, the primary differences between the models is in their use and organisation of different types of layers and the loss function selected for the respective models.

The most commonly used architecture for neural networks that in the surveyed literature is a CNN \citep{Park:2017,Gamback:2017,Wulczyn:2017,Kolhatkar:2021,Zimmerman:2018,Wang:2020}. As CNNs have been the subject of particularly interest, a number of distinct modelling approaches have been proposed. First, relying a simple neural network architecture, \citet{Kolhatkar:2021} use GloVe embeddings as the first layer, followed by three convolutional layers (that have window sizes $3, 4,$ and $5$, respectively) with global maximum pooling layers. Prior to passing to an output layer, dropout is applied to the output of the convolutional layers which is then passed to a dense layer. For all layers prior to the output layer use a ReLU (see \cref{chap:nlp} for more detail) activation function. The output layer applies the sigmoid function to provide a prediction from the model. This model most closely resembles the CNN architecture used in this chapter. As this model uses a pre-trained word-embedding layer as its input layer, the input the model receives are documents that have been subject to tokenisation processes.

A different architecture is proposed by \citet{Park:2017}. In their work they compare a single classifier, what they dub a `one-step classifier', that predicts the final classes directly with a stacked architecture of two models, or a `two-step classifier' in their vernacular that first predicts whether content is abusive and second predicts which type of abuse the documents predicted as abusive are. There are two governing distinctions between the two-step architecture proposed by \citet{Park:2017} and the architecture proposed by \citet{Kolhatkar:2021}. First, \citet{Kolhatkar:2021} acts as a one-step classifier whereas the architecture proposed by \citet{Park:2017} acts in two steps. Second, \citet{Kolhatkar:2021} only acts on documents tokenised into words and punctuation whereas \citet{Park:2017} propose a CNN that takes documents tokenised into words and punctuation in addition to documents tokenised into characters. \citet{Park:2017} show that through the use of a one-step CNN trained on word and character input, they achieve a performance boost obtaining a F1-score of $0.827$ on the datasets proposed by \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016} and \citet{Waseem:2016}, though the performance boost is lost once a two-step hybrid CNN is used.

As CNNs build feature mappings by passing over the data using filters, they come with certain assumptions built into them. As researchers define the number of filters and the stride size, they also define the range within which they believe that relevant terms are likely to occur. The implication of this is then that there will likely be some, potentially overlapping, ranges that the models learn patterns from. Depending on how researchers define these, the models will develop feature mappings corresponding to the ranges provided.

Another frequently used architecture is LSTMs \citep{Badjatiya:2017,Kolhatkar:2021,Meyer:2019}. Here, \citet{Kolhatkar:2021} propose using a bi-directional LSTM that, like their CNN, has a pre-trained embedding layer, a recurrent layer, a dropout layer, and a fully connected output layer with a sigmoid activation to predict the output classes. \citet{Meyer:2019} on the other hand take develop on the idea of a hybrid CNN, developing a LSTM architecture that takes documents tokenised into words and characters as input. The word representation is obtained through tokenisation passed through an embedding layer and the character representation is obtained by processing the documents with a CNN.
Using these approaches, \citet{Kolhatkar:2021} show comparable performances between the CNN and bi-directional LSTM on their dataset. \citet{Meyer:2019} on the other hand show that a baseline model only using character level information performs comparably with other more complex approaches, obtaining a macro F1-score of $0.7923$ for the baseline and $0.7924$ for the final system on the dataset proposed by \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016}, and notably outperforms several other previously proposed methods.

The use of LSTMs, that rely on recurrence, break with the independence assumption of the manual feature-based models. By recurring over a document, each new token is considered in conjunction with the previous tokens that have not been forgotten. In this way, an assumption is built into the models that through processing enough token sequences, it will be possible to identify patterns that connote abuse. Such a reliance on the text alone does not consider the positionality of abuse; \citet{Waseem:2018} argue only through understanding the context within which the speaker and audience exist in, is it possible to deem something as abusive. For instance, it is only through an understanding of the speaker that one can deem whether the \textit{n-word} is weaponised as abuse or is reclaimed to connote complex social identity.\vspace{5mm}

All methods described that rely on documents tokenised into sentences rely on pre-trained embedding layers (most frequently GloVe \citet{Pennington:2014}) that come with their own benefits and costs. For instance, word embeddings that are trained on web-text are likely to harbour social biases \citep{Bolukbasi:2016} that have been proven hard to address \citep{Gonen:2019}. On the other hand, they also allow for better representations of related concepts and will be less susceptible to creating different representations for closely related concepts as a result of dataset biases. For instance, the concepts `Television' and `T.V.' might only be distantly related, if at all, in a small dataset due to few co-occurrences within the dataset. In a larger dataset, spanning millions of documents, these two concepts are likely to appear as closely related as a robust language representation will likely have been achieved for such commonly occurring tokens.
The methods that rely on character embeddings are also subject to similar distributional concerns, however this can be a benefit when used in conjunction with word embeddings. As there are only a much smaller set of possible characters compared to words, less data is needed to train robust embedding layers, though the trained character embeddings will be particularly attuned to the dataset at hand. On the other hand, due to such particularity of the character embeddings, they are less likely to map well onto other domains even if they show good performance on the dataset that they are derived from.\vspace{5mm}

For the work in this chapter, the use of pre-trained embeddings is not appropriate for some models. Specifically the models that use LIWC-represented documents as LIWC embeddings are not publicly available or have been developed, to the best of my knowledge. Moreover, documents represented through LIWC categories are poorly suited for training general embeddings as only a small set of tokens are defined and they are not necessarily distributed in a fashion suitable for developing generalised such embeddings. Second, I don't use pre-trained embeddings in the architectures for all other models to ensure that any comparisons with the LIWC-based models are a direct comparison of the influence of using LIWC as input tokens and avoiding potentially confounding factors.

\subsection{Datasets}\label{sub:liwc_datasets}
In order to understand and validate my approach, I train a model on multiple datasets. Moreover, I take each model that is learned on a given dataset and apply it to all other datasets. To accommodate prediction on a model trained on one dataset to others, I reduced all classification tasks to a binary task of abusive and not-abusive. This has downstream implications for the construction of the datasets and for the validity of the prediction task on the auxiliary datasets.
First, the dataset distributions are modified as tasks with more than two classes see their data collapsed. For the some datasets, this means that the class imbalances are improved, as the majority class is non-abusive. The exception to this is the dataset proposed by \citet{Davidson:2017} where the largest class is the `offensive' class, which I combine with `hateful', further minimising the negative class.
Second, as each dataset has been collected with different rationales and annotated with distinct purposes (please see \cref{sub:abuse_data} for more detail), direct comparisons, and subsequently model predictions on each dataset, can be at odds with the goals of the datasets. For this reason, high scores on prediction metrics on external datasets should be viewed as a weak indication of the ability to identify general patterns while low scores can indicate a number of factors including, but not limited to, highly distinct data sources, annotation strategies, and lastly the questions each dataset inherently seeks to ask.

With these concerns in mind, I decide to use datasets with distinct sources and are developed for different purposes. Rather than resist or seek to minimise the modelling concerns, I choose to lean into them to allow space for understanding how LIWC-based modelling may influence the training and model performance on each dataset as well as seek to gain an understanding on which axes model generalisation may be afforded using LIWC-based modelling (see \cref{tab:vocab_sizes} for the vocabulary sizes for each dataset and input type).

In this chapter I use the \textit{StormFront} dataset~\citep{Garcia:2019}, the \textit{Offence} dataset \citep{Davidson:2017}, the \textit{Hate Speech} dataset~\citep{Waseem-Hovy:2016}, the \textit{Expert Hate} dataset~\citep{Waseem:2016}, and finally the \textit{Toxicity} dataset~\citep{Wulczyn:2017} (please see \cref{sub:abuse_data} for a detailed overview on each dataset).

\subsubsection{StormFront}
First, I use the \textit{StormFront} dataset which is collected from the white supremacist web forum by \citet{Garcia:2019}. The data consists of $2,392$, split into $1,531$ training documents, $383$ documents for validation, and $478$ test documents. While the full dataset published consists of $10,000$ documents annotated as `hate' and `not-hate', with a large class imbalance towards non-abusive comments, I choose to use a balanced subset of the data provided by the authors to test how LIWC-based models perform when trained on a) small data and b) a balanced data distribution.
The dataset is initially split into a training and a test set, I created a validation set by pulling extracting a stratified sample from the training data, retaining the class balance from the balanced subset.

\subsubsection{Offence}
The second dataset used to train and evaluate my models is the \textit{Offence} dataset collected from Twitter by \citet{Davidson:2017}. This dataset was collected to distinguish offensive tweets from hateful ones. This dataset is distinguished from all other datasets in that the positive classes, i.e. `offensive' and `hateful' accounting for $1,430$ documents and $19,190$ documents, respectively. This leaves only $4,163$ documents in the negative class. Once binarised, the dataset consists of $4,163$ documents in the negative class and $20,620$ documents in the positive class. The dataset is provided by the authors as a single file containing all documents, so I create stratified splits of the data into a training set ($80\%$ or $19,826$ documents), a validation set ($10\%$ or $2,478$ documents), and a test set ($10\%$ or $2,479$ documents), retaining the class distribution in each split. Using this dataset further allows for an investigation into how sensitive LIWC-based modelling is to dataset skews.

\subsubsection{Hate Speech}
I also use the \textit{Hate Speech} dataset, which is collected from Twitter by \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016}. This dataset contains $16,914$ documents that follow a more traditional class distribution for abusive language data. In this dataset the positive classes of `racism' and `sexism' are collapsed into a single positive class, `abuse', consisting of $5,355$ documents and the negative class occupying the remaining $11,559$ documents. The primary function this dataset serves in this chapter is to allow some insight into whether the LIWC-based models would function under a distinct annotation criteria that is motivated by academic studies in Gender Studies and Critical Race Theory on marginalisation, rather than social media guidelines for acceptable behaviour.

\subsubsection{Expert Hate}
The \textit{Expert Hate} dataset proposed by \citet{Waseem:2016} contains $6,909$ documents and is also collected from Twitter and is also designed as a multi-class classification task. In this dataset the positive classes consist of `sexism' ($13\%$ or $898$ documents), `racism' ($1.41\%$ or $97$ documents) and `both' ($0.70\%$ or $48$ documents) while the negative class consists of $84.19\%$ of the dataset. I reduce this down to a binary classification task and split the dataset into a training set ($80\%$ or $5,527$ documents), a validation set ($10\%$ or $690$ documents), and a test set ($10\%$ or $692$ documents) ensuring that binary the class distribution is retained. This dataset is annotated following the annotation guidelines proposed by \citet{Waseem-Hovy:2016}, however it is annotated using intersectional feminist activists as crowd-workers. This dataset then allows for testing the influence of LIWC-based models on data annotated by experts.

\subsubsection{Toxicity}
Finally, I use the \textit{Toxicity} dataset published by \citet{Wulczyn:2017}. This dataset was collected from Wikipedia editor discussion pages and annotated as `toxic' and `not-toxic' and it is the largest dataset with $159,686$ documents. These documents are provided split into a training set consisting of $95,692$ documents, a validation set with $32,128$ documents and a test set containing $31,866$ documents. Similarly to the \textit{Hate Speech} and \textit{Expert Hate} datasets, this dataset is highly imbalanced with the positive class accounting for $~16\%$ of the entire dataset. I use this dataset to gain an understanding of how large scale datasets can influences the performance, size, and training time of LIWC-based models.

\section{Modelling}\label{sec:liwc_modelling}

In efforts to understand the impact of LIWC-based modelling, I design feature-based and neural network models. I develop a Logistic Regression and a SVM model with a linear kernel for each type of input data (Word unigrams, BPE unigrams, and LIWC unigrams) to allow for feature-based analysis of what patterns are identified. To investigate how neural network models operate on the input data, I develop three types of neural networks for each input type: First, I train a MLP to provide an initial insight into whether neural network approaches might be appropriate, second I develop a LSTM model to investigate whether there are any benefits from its recurrent nature and finally, I develop a CNN model due to their dominance in the literature.\vspace{5mm}

I specify two different training procedures, one for the linear baseline models and one for the neural networks.
For the linear baseline models, I tokenise and pre-process the data and perform a grid-search over the parameter space.
For neural network models, I similarly tokenise and pre-process the data and perform a Bayesian hyper-parameter search to identify the best performing parameter setting given by macro F1-score. I then reuse this best performing parameter settings and re-run the model with 5 different random seeds to ensure that the behaviour of the model on the dataset is not the result of the consequences of the random seed propagated into a model's initialisation of its tensors.

\subsection{Pre-processing}

Prior to providing any model data, it is necessary to pre-process the data to make it suitable for the experiment conducted. In my experiments I examine how modifying the vocabulary that a model relies on might influence model construction. To this effect, it is necessary to have some distinct pre-processing steps for the datasets depending on the experiment while others are shared. For the shared pre-processing steps, I lower-case all documents, replace all usernames, that follow the Twitter standard of an `@' followed by a string, with a generic \textit{<USER>} token, replace all website URLs with a generic \textit{<URL>} token, and finally, replace all hashtags with a generic \textit{<HASHTAG>} token. The resulting vocabulary sizes for each dataset and data type can be seen in \cref{tab:vocab_sizes}.

For the LIWC-based models and the word-based models, I pre-process documents using the python library Ekphrasis \citep{baziotis:2017} which was developed specifically to handle the particularities of social media texts. One such particularity is the use of elongation of words which the library addresses by mapping to the unelongated form, e.g. `heyyyy' is mapped to `hey' (see \cref{bpe_tok} and \cref{tab:liwc_tok} for examples of tokenisation). No further processing is done for experiments using word tokens as input.

\end{table}

For the LIWC experiments on the other hand, I take another step after the initial tokenisation to compute the LIWC categories invoked by each word. Each token obtained is passed through a function which identifies all LIWC categories that the token invokes and combines them into a single token, where each LIWC category is separated by an underscore. All tokens that are not recognised by LIWC are replaced with a general token for \textit{<UNK>} token (see \cref{tab:liwc_tok} for examples on the result of the pre-processing of documents).

For the BPE-based models on the other hand, I pre-process documents by computing using the 200-dimensional Byte-Pair Embeddings from the BPE python library \citep{Heinzerling:2018}. Byte-Pair Encodings are well suited to handle the particularities of social media text, as it breaks unrecognised words into subwords, thus minimising unknown tokens in the validation and test sets. Through this process, the hope is that even if part of a of a word is out-of-vocabulary for the model some of its subwords will be within a model's vocabulary, allowing the remaining subwords to be used for inference.

In reviewing \cref{tab:vocab_sizes}, it is clear that computing LIWC representations result in smaller vocabularies while BPE representations of the documents results in similar sized vocabularies for all datasets with the exception of the BPE representation of the \textit{StormFront} dataset and the \textit{Offence} dataset where the vocabulary sizes decrease slightly. It is unsurprising that the vocabulary size would grow using BPE as subwords for all unrecognised tokens are computed using the Byte-Pair Encoding. More surprising is the small drop in BPE vocabulary sizes. These drops suggest that a set of the words that are unrecognised by the pre-trained Byte-Pair Embeddings as complete words share a relatively small set of subwords.

\zw{Double check these numbers after retraining}
For the documents represented through the LIWC categories that they invoke, I observe a sharp decline in the sizes of the vocabularies, with the smallest decrease in vocabulary being an $88.6\%$ decrease while the largest decrease is $99.7\%$. This is expected as the LIWC dictionary only encompasses a small number of words as many words used in informal conversations on online platforms are likely to fall outside of those considered when developing the dictionary. Moreover, it is also not surprising that a drop would occur as many of the datasets are created and published after the creation of the LIWC dictionary and examine domains that are unlikely to be well represented within the LIWC dictionary. Consequently will be subject to some language drift in addition to domain shifts.

Considering \cref{tab:liwc_vocab_overlaps,tab:word_vocab_overlaps,tab:bpe_vocab_overlaps} that display the token distribution for each type of input on each dataset, there are some clear implications for my research questions.
First, only minor distributional shifts between word-based vocabularies (see \cref{tab:word_vocab_overlaps}) and BPE-based vocabularies (see \cref{tab:bpe_vocab_overlaps}). As processing and representing documents as their byte-pair represented counter-parts results in the computation of subwords, such small distributional discrepancies are to be expected.
Second, observing the differences between LIWC vocabulary distributions (see \cref{tab:liwc_vocab_overlaps}) and the word vocabulary distributions, it is clear that the distributional changes are large and that the LIWC-based representation has large ramifications on the datasets and subsequently models trained for the task.
For instance, as the vast majority of tokens are shared between both classes, there are fewer potential signals for models to overfit to, e.g. where a word-based model trained on the \textit{Toxicity} dataset may have at least $73,051$ unique tokens, that is $76.3\%$ of all unique tokens in the dataset, that it can potentially learn spurious correlations on, a LIWC-based model is only provided with $136$ unique tokens, or $13.3\%$ of all unique tokens, that it is likely to overfit to.\footnote{In both instances disregarding the possibility of over-fitting to the patterns of occurrences between different tokens.}
Similarly to n-gram character-based modelling, a smaller set of unique tokens is likely to result in a matrix that, in places, more dense, allowing for a model to identify patterns based on the interaction of tokens rather than individual tokens. This particular case is likely for LIWC-based models as the vast majority (between $64\%$ and $86\%$) of tokens are shared between both classes.

\subsection{Linear Baseline Models}\label{sec:baseline_models}

For the linear baseline models, I train several different linear models (i.e. Logistic Regression models and SVMs) that function as baselines using the \citet{Pedregosa:2015}. 
For each algorithm, I train three different models: a) surface-token based model that uses sentences tokenised into words, b) models on the Byte-Pair encoded representation, and c) models that uses the LIWC-based representation as their input data. 
For all baseline models, I only use token unigrams as features, as these provide competitive baselines for many of the datasets (see \autoref{tab:liwc_baseline_linear_scores}). 
To ensure that the baseline models use the most appropriate, I perform a cross-validated grid-search (as implemented by \citet{Pedregosa:2015}) over all possible setting of the model parameters for each model.
For both SVM and Logistic Regression models, I explore values of $C\in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, \ldots, 0.9]$ to examine the strength of regularisation, and I explore with $L1$ and $L2$ regularisers. 
For Logistic Regression, I also set the parameter search to consider \textit{Elasticnet} as a third regulariser option.
All linear baseline models prefer an L2 regularisation. Considering \cref{tab:liwc_baseline_linear_params}, it is clear that in most cases using a word token input results in the best scores on the development set, the exception to the rule being the \textit{Hate Expert} dataset. However, an interesting pattern emerges, for many of the models, using the LIWC-tokenised input provides highly competitive results, suggesting the efficacy of using LIWC-based tokenisation even on linear models, a promising sign for the subsequent experiments.

In the training procedure for the linear models, I first fit a count vectoriser on the training data and fit a model to the vectorised training data. For prediction on other datasets, all datasets are passed through vectoriser fitted to the training data. This ensures that all datasets are processed and indexed in accordance to the vocabulary of the training dataset and the model. A notably difference between the training of linear models and their neural network counterparts is that linear models are only provided with the dataset once for each cross-validation set and the order of the documents in the dataset is not randomised whereas the neural network models iterate multiple times over the training dataset where the order of the documents in the dataset is shuffled between each iteration.

\subsection{Neural Models}\label{sec:redux_neural}

I implement three different neural network model types using PyTorch~\citep{Paszke:2019} and perform a hyper-parameter search on each model type for every dataset and input type. Specifically, I implement a Multi-Layered Perceptron model, a Long-Short Term Memory network, and a Convolutional Neural Network.
I choose to implement an MLP as it is the simplest form of neural networks and it can provide early insights into the applicability of neural network based architectures.
As the LIWC tokens are distributed such that the vast majority of tokens are shared by both classes, I also train a LSTM network to take long-range dependencies into account. I choose a LSTM over a basic RNN model as unknown tokens are likely to occur frequently in the LIWC-based data due to the small size of the dictionary and resulting vocabularies, and it may be desirable for any recurrent model trained on the data to be afforded the ability to forget sequences of unknown tokens.
Finally, I train a CNN model as this model type has been dominant in the literature.

In order to focus on the utility of the different document representations, I train models with simple architectures. To this end, I also don't use pre-trained embeddings as embedding layers within the model as I am not aware of any general purpose pre-trained LIWC-embeddings and, as is apparent from \cref{tab:liwc_tok}, the LIWC tokens generated for each token would most likely be out-of-vocabulary for most pre-trained word embeddings. Instead I opt to train the embedding layer along with all other layers.
To address the issue of the model over-fitting the data, either by identifying spurious correlations in the data or by over-training the model, I subject each model to dropout and early stopping (see \cref{sec:dropoutearly} for more detail on dropout and early stopping). To address the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients, I employ gradient clipping \citep{Bengio:1994}, to normalise the value of the gradients in the training procedures.\vspace{5mm}

I use a single training procedure for all models to control the influence of confounding factors in the training process.
The models are given data, which they iterate over in a pre-defined number of epochs, shuffling the dataset between each epoch. Within each epoch, batches of the data through are passed through the model for prediction during training.
The loss following the model performance is then back-propagated through model, updating the internal representation in the process.
This process is repeated for the assigned maximum number of epochs, or the model triggers the early stopping \citep{Early-stopping paper here} criteria, which is that the computed loss has been strictly increasing for at least $15$ epochs.
Once a model has finished training, performance in terms of macro F1-score, precision, recall and accuracy are computed on the validation set and test sets. 
To be able to speak to the training time, I start a timer when the model training procedure is initiated and stop the timer when the model has fully completed it's training, but prior to any inference made using the model.
I repeat this process for at least $200$ unique trials for each model and dataset combination and use the F1-score on the validation set to identify the best configuration of hyper-parameters.
Once the best hyper-parameters are selected, I rerun the models with $5$ different random seeds and obtain these models' performance on all test sets, including the in-domain test for the dataset the models are trained on and the out-of-domain test sets from the remaining datasets.

\subsection{Hyper-Parameter Search}\label{sub:liwc_hyperparam}

In efforts to identify the best hyper-parameters without performing a grid-search of all possible combinations, I turn towards Bayesian Hyper-Parameter Tuning \citep{Neal:1996}. Briefly, Bayesian Optimisation allows for estimating the best hyper-parameters for a model through a series of trials with different hyper-parameter settings. I use the implementation of Bayesian Hyper-Parameter Optimisation offered through \citet{Wandb} and set the objective of the hyper-parameter optimisation to maximise the macro F1-score on the development data (please refer to \cref{sub:bho} for more detail).

The parameters that I perform the optimisation for varies across the different model types as they require different hyper-parameters to be defined. A set of hyper-parameters are constant across models: the size of mini-batches provided to the model for training, the learning rate, the number of epochs, and the embedding size. For each dataset and model type, I perform at last $200$ trials with different parameter settings, leading to choosing a final set of hyper-parameters that I run with five different random seeds.
The values for the learning rate are sampled from a uniform distribution while the batch size and number of training epochs are sampled from a categorical distribution. More generally, the values for all hyper-parameters, asides from dropout and the learning rate are sampled from a categorical distribution.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Maximum epoch count: $\{50, 100, 200\}$,
  \item Batch size: $\{16, 32, 64\}$,
  \item learning rate: $[0.00001, 1.0]$
\end{itemize}

\label{tab:redux_embedding_hatespeech_params}
\end{table}

As a result of the $200$ trials, several parameter settings compete to be the best performing model, with little difference in their scores on the validation set. Although only the model with the highest macro F1-score performance on the validation set is chosen, I make note of the top $5$ models, should one of the best performing models result in inconsistent results across different values of the random seed. The hyper-parameters for the best and most stably performing model are presented in \cref{tab:redux_embedding_offence_params,tab:redux_embedding_toxicity_params,tab:redux_embedding_hate_expert_params,tab:redux_embedding_hatespeech_params,tab:redux_embedding_stormfront_params}.

Taking the best performing hyper-parameters, I re-run each model and dataset combination with five different random seeds ($22$, $32$, $42$, $310$, and $922$) and display the macro F1 scores and the loss on the in-domain validation sets in \cref{fig:davidson_dev_f1,fig:davidson_dev_loss,fig:wulczyn_dev_f1,fig:wulczyn_dev_loss,fig:waseem_dev_f1,fig:waseem_dev_loss,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_f1,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_loss,fig:garcia_dev_f1,fig:garcia_dev_loss} as the models are trained.
Note, that in \cref{fig:davidson_dev_f1,fig:wulczyn_dev_f1,fig:waseem_dev_f1,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_f1,fig:garcia_dev_f1} the standard deviations is depicted through shading whereas in \cref{fig:davidson_dev_loss,fig:wulczyn_dev_loss,fig:waseem_dev_loss,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_loss,fig:garcia_dev_loss} the shading represents the standard error.\footnote{I display the standard error here, rather than the standard deviation, as displaying the standard deviation on a log scale results in unreadable graphs due to outliers. Ignoring outliers in producing the graph has the natural consequence that parts of the graph exist outside of the displayed area.}
Moreover, as loss values most frequently are small, I display the losses ona  logarithmic scale to allow for more readable figures.\vspace{5mm}

In observing the F1-scores on the validation sets in \cref{fig:davidson_dev_f1,fig:wulczyn_dev_f1,fig:waseem_dev_f1,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_f1,fig:garcia_dev_f1}, a general pattern emerges in which most models, regardless of input type, display similar learning curves.
A notable exceptions to these are the models trained on the \textit{StormFront} dataset (see \cref{fig:garcia_dev_f1}), in which two general patterns emerge: the first which has large variability in the models' performance from epoch to epoch and tends to trigger the early stopping criteria earlier, and the second which has a more stable learning curve with smaller performance drops and improvements between each epoch and trains for more epochs.
Another exception can be observed in the models trained on \textit{Toxicity} dataset (see \cref{fig:wulczyn_dev_f1}). Here three salient trends occur.
In the first, models start with a high F1-score and show little improvement as over the epochs and trigger early stopping. 
In the second, models start with a lower F1-score and show steady improvements until early stopping is triggered,
% TODO Move this down to when I specifically look at the Wulczyn graphs?
with the exception of the LIWC CNN models which starts with relatively stable performance before having a large variability bin performance from epoch to epoch, finally stabilising briefly before early stopping is triggered.
The third trend, starts with a relatively low model performance (below $0.4$ in F1-score) and only trigger early stopping late in the process (if ever). As these models train, there is an early sharp increase in the model performances followed by reaching a plateau and only post minor improvements in the later epochs.

Turning to the loss developments in \cref{fig:davidson_dev_loss,fig:wulczyn_dev_loss,fig:waseem_dev_loss,fig:waseem_hovy_dev_loss,fig:garcia_dev_loss} there are three unique patterns: first, the loss rises throughout the training process; second, the loss remains almost entirely unchanged throughout the entire training process, and finally the third pattern; the loss is volatile throughout the process, rising or dropping from epoch to epoch.

\subsubsection{Multi-Layered Perceptron}

The first neural architecture that I implement is a Multi-Layered Perceptron. I choose this model as it is the simplest form of a neural network and thus well suited for an initial investigation into the feasibility of neural network approaches for the LIWC-based representations. The MLP architecture that I use also lays the basis for the architectures for all other neural network based models in this chapter. The network consists of an embedding input layer, a hidden layer, an output layer, and a softmax layer which produces the probabilities for each class (please refer to \cref{fig:liwc_mlp} for a depiction of the model). I subject the model's representation to a dropout layer and a non-linear activation function between the input layer and hidden layer, and the hidden and output layer.
\afterpage{
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{mlp.jpg}
  \caption{Multi-Layered Perceptron model architecture.}
  \label{fig:liwc_mlp}
\end{figure}
}
I perform a hyper-parameter search over shared the hyper-parameters detailed in \cref{sub:liwc_hyperparam} in addition to the following hyper-parameter values, that are specific to the MLP:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dropout probability: $[0.0, 0.5]$,
  \item hidden layer dimension: $\{64, 100, 200, 300\}$, and
  \item the activation function: $\{ReLU, Tanh\}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Long-Short Term Memory}

The second model I choose to implement is a LSTM model. This model was chosen as its recurrent nature allows for experiments that can offer insights into the efficacy of the model recalling long and short-range interactions between tokens in the data. I choose the LSTM variant of an RNN over a vanilla RNN as LIWC encoded documents are likely to have several out-of-vocabulary tokens between each known token and thus retaining all information about such unknown tokens may not be conducive to identifying salient patterns in LIWC token representation.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{lstm.jpg}
  \caption{Long-Short Term Memory Network model architecture.}
  \label{fig:liwc_lstm}
\end{figure}

I implement a simple architecture for the LSTM model to retain focus on the input types and to avoid the influence of confounding factors such as attention. The LSTM consists of an input embedding layer, a uni-directional LSTM layer, a linear output layer, and a softmax to produce the class probabilities (see \autoref{fig:liwc_lstm} for a depiction of the LSTM model).
I apply a dropout to the output of the input layer and the output of the LSTM layer in efforts to prevent the model from over-fitting on any particular pattern. I use the PyTorch implementation of an LSTM which uses a Tanh activation function \citep{Paszke:2019}, for which reason I do not apply other non-linearities to the model.

Thus, for the LSTM our hyper-parameter tuning considers the following parameters and values:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dropout probability: $[0.0, 0.5]$,
  \item embedding layer dimension: $\{64, 100, 200, 300\}$, and
  \item hidden layer dimension: $\{64, 100, 200, 300\}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Network}

For the final neural network architecture, I use a Convolutional Neural Network due to its dominance in the literature (see \cref{sec:liwc_nn}) and its use in commercial tools (e.g. the Perspective API). Similarly to the MLP and LSTM, the input layer is an embedding layer, followed by three two-dimensional convolutional layers, each of which are subject to a non-linear activation function, a one dimensional max-pooling layer, and a output layer. The representation obtained through the output layer is subjected to a softmax function that computes the probability distribution for the classes (see \cref{fig:liwc_cnn} for a depiction of the network).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{cnn.jpg}
  \caption{Convolutional Neural Network model architecture.}
  \label{fig:liwc_cnn}
\end{figure}

Unlike the MLP and LSTM models, the CNN models are not subject to a dropout. However as the CNN requires window sizes to be set, for the sliding window and the number of filters the convolutional layer is to apply, these are added as hyper-parameters to tune. The hyper-parameters tuned by the model are thus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item window size: $\{(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5)\}$,
  \item Number of filters: $\{64, 128, 256\}$,
  \item hidden layer dimension: $\{64, 100, 200, 300\}$, and
  \item the activation function: $\{ReLU, Tanh\}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

To answer the research questions set forth, I examine three different aspects of my models: First, I examine the model performances on a held out test set from dataset they are trained on in an effort to answer whether a LIWC representation is appropriate for modelling.
Second, I compare the model performances on the test sets of datasets that they are not trained on. Finally, I observe the time it takes for models to be trained using the different representations.
To answer these questions, I develop three different neural network types and train each one on each of the five datasets introduced in \cref{sub:liwc_datasets}, resulting in $45$ different model architectures trained. These $45$ model architectures are then subject to at least $200$ hyper-parameter selection trials, resulting in over $9,000$ models trained in the process of identifying the best hyper-parameters. Once the hyper-parameters are determined, I perform an additional $5$ runs for each model architecture, examining the influence of the random seed.

\subsection{Baseline Models}
In \cref{tab:linear_offence_baselines,tab:linear_toxicity_baselines,tab:linear_hateExp_baselines,tab:linear_hatespeech_baselines,tab:linear_stormfront_baselines}, though only baselines, there are a number of interesting patterns that emerge.
First, the baselines validate the hypothesis that LIWC-based representation can serve as a viable input to machine learning models, as the LIWC-based models often achieve competing scores, and in some instances outperforms models with other data representations, e.g. in recall on the in-domain prediction on the \textit{Offence} test data (see \cref{tab:linear_offence_baselines}) and the F1-score achieved on the out-of-domain datasets, for instance for the models trained on the \textit{Toxicity} dataset (see \cref{tab:linear_toxicity_baselines}).


% The validation scores described in \cref{tab:linear_offence_baselines,tab:linear_toxicity_baselines,tab:linear_hateExp_baselines,tab:linear_hatespeech_baselines,tab:linear_stormfront_baselines} are not as strong as the state-of-the-art in-domain models \cite{Fortuna:2018}, in fact scores for the they are comparable to the scores reported on the test set of the in the original paper \cite{Davidson:2017} which provided initial baseline scores.\footnote{We do not report these baseline scores as their work does not identify which weighting of their F1-score was used.}. While several previous work augment the textual data with syntactic knowledge \cite{Davidson:2017} or advanced token representations \cite{Salminen:2020} to boost classification performance, we only use the byte-pair encoded documents and the LIWC encoded documents, to ensure comparability with our experimental models. Moreover, as our primary concern is learning classifiers whose performance generalise to other datasets, unlike much prior work which concerns itself with learning classifiers that perform well within the dataset, we do not take further steps towards boosting our baseline classifiers in-domain performances.

Second, though the baselines often produce substandard classification performances on out-of-domain data, ranging from random performance to worse than a majority baseline, they sometimes do yield surprisingly good results along individual metrics. E.g. in \cref{tab:linear_hateExp_baselines} a word-token model achieves a high performance on the \citet{Toxicity} dataset while a LIWC-based model posts surprisingly high scores on the \textit{Offence} dataset.

Third, many of the LIWC-based models post strong performances on in-domain data, suggesting that simple linear models may be highly appropriate for the LIWC-based input.
Moreover, these strong in-domain performances also provide a weak suggestion that neural network architectures as most of the of the datasets that are under consideration are, in neural network terms, small datasets consisting of thousands, rather than several hundred thousand documents.
Fourth, an interesting trend of the models trained on the \textit{Offence} and the \textit{Toxicity} datasets obtain surprisingly good scores on each other. There are two potential reasons for this trend, 1) the two datasets are the largest in datasets so more general patterns may be learned, 2) as the notion of ``offensive'' as constructed by \citet{Davidson:2017} bears strong similarities with the notion of ``toxicity'' constructed by \citet{Wulczyn:2017}, yielding in subsets of the datasets that strongly share similarities with each other.

\end{table}

Finally, although these baseline models do obtain surprisingly good scores for many of the models, there are several instances of noteworthy performance drops between the word-token and BPE-token models and their LIWC counterpart, notably the LIWC-based models often perform well on some metrics, but fall short on others. For instance in \cref{tab:linear_stormfront_baselines,tab:linear_hatespeech_baselines}, the LIWC-based models perform well on recall and perform poorly on F1-score. Thus, within the space of these strong results there is room for improvement for more stable performances on other metrics.
As most of the datasets are imbalanced, I focus my attention on the macro F1-score performance due to its particular ability to handle imbalanced data well and its use in the previous literature \citep{Macro F1 papers}.

\subsection{Neural models}

In \cref{fig:davidson_models_test,fig:wulczyn_models_test,fig:waseem_models_test,fig:waseem_hovy_models_test,fig:garcia_models_test}, I show the in-domain and out-of-domain results of using the neural network architectures described in \cref{sec:liwc_modelling} for modelling abuse using the three different document representations. The bars in each figure represent the scores of each models on the test set in question, e.g. in \cref{fig:davidson_models_test} I show the macro F1-scores achieved by all models on the test set for the \citet{Offence} dataset.
Considering figures collectively, it's clear that in-domain models in most cases, predictably, out-perform models trained on out-of-domain datasets. Interestingly, it's also clear that while LIWC-based models in many cases are comparable to models using full surface-form vocabulary. Moreover, this similarity in performance largely also holds for out-of-domain performance.
Out-of-domain performance too is worthy of note in comparison with in-domain models and other out-of-domain models and with the linear baselines. Curiously, in spite of improved performance on in-domain test sets, there is a general trend of slightly decreased performance on out-of-domain data.

One dataset however, is notable in its in-domain and all out-of-domain predictions: The \textit{StormFront} dataset. Notably, linear models perform at par, or better than all configurations of neural models. The most likely explanation for this can be found in the small dataset size of less than $3,000$ documents. One way to address such a short-coming of this dataset is to increase the dataset size. Although the experiments I conduct with the dataset keep the number of documents lower than the total annotated set in order to maintain a balanced dataset, the dataset does in some cases outperform models trained on larger dataset for out-of-domain prediction. Specifically, models trained on the \textit{StormFront} dataset have comparable out-of-domain classification performance with the \textit{Offence} dataset on the test sets for the \textit{Hate Expert} and \textit{Hate Speech} datasets (see \cref{fig:waseem_models_test,fig:waseem_hovy_models_test}).

More generally, from the out-of-domain classification performances, there seems to be a correlation with annotation guideline similarity and out-of-domain performance. For instance, in \cref{fig:davidson_models_test,fig:wulczyn_models_test} I observe that models trained on the \textit{Offence} and \textit{Toxicity} datasets outperform models trained on other datasets. For both of these datasets, the governing understanding of abuse and hate speech are that not all speech that is offensive is necessarily also problematic as the \textit{Offence} dataset specifically seeks to disentangle hate from offence and \textit{Toxicity} asks its annotators to identify the documents that may make participants in a conversation exit the conversation. Thus, for these two datasets, the governing question is not necessarily the protection of marginalised communities and identities but instead identifying a degree of acceptable abuse and hostility.

In contrast, the \textit{Hate Expert} and \textit{Hate Speech} datasets seek to identify communications that are harmful to marginalised communities. Thus, it's no surprise that the out-of-domain performances for models trained on these two datasets perform reasonably well with each other. However here it is also clear that there is an influence of dataset size. Where the \textit{Hate Speech} dataset consists of $~16,000$ documents, the \textit{Hate Expert} dataset consists of $~7,000$ documents, which is also apparent from the fact that the models trained on the \textit{Hate Speech} dataset perform better on the \textit{Hate Expert} test set than the models trained on the \textit{Hate Expert} dataset perform on the \textit{Hate Speech} dataset.

The \textit{StormFront} dataset on the other hand is annotated to identify deliberate attacks against ``specific group[s] of people'' on the basis of their group membership or characteristics of group's identities \citep{Garcia:2019}. This annotation criteria forms a subset of the annotation guidelines that are used for the \textit{Hate Speech} and \textit{Hate Expert} datasets. Moreover, the collection strategies for the three datasets also share common characteristics. Where \citet{Garcia:2019} specifically seek out content from a white supremacist forum for their dataset, \citet{Waseem:2016,Waseem-Hovy:2016} sample from Twitter by searching for keywords that were likely to result in a large set of abuse. Thus, while the domain of the data and the annotation guidelines are not the same, there are likely to be similarities in the content and annotations produced.

Attending to the questions surrounding the use of LIWC to represent documents for modelling abuse, I turn to the baseline and experimental model performances on the validation and test sets of the LIWC-based models. In the validation sets for the linear baselines (see \cref{tab:liwc_baseline_linear_params}), the LIWC-based methods do not outperform any other model type, for some datasets, a highly competitive score is obtained (e.g. $0.9207$ for LIWC-based SVM model against $0.9222$ for a word-token based SVM). For other datasets however, the score obtained by LIWC-based models is much lower, suggesting that LIWC-based modelling may be an appropriate means of modelling abuse under some conditions.
For the neural network based models a similar story presents itself, although

\section{Conclusions and future work}

\zw{Something about BERT based models}
BERT \cite{Koufakou,Vidgen,Tran:2020,Isaksen:2020}
As our aim is to consider the influence of LIWC-represented documents, we do not consider the more recent pre-trained Transformer-based language models \citep[e.g.]{Devlin:2019,Liu:2019} as the amounts of data necessary to train such a masked language model with LIWC representations are unavailable. Moreover, as the LIWC dictionary only occupies a small fraction of the entire English lexicon, and its tokens are abstractions on use of the language, training a language model is a fruitless endeavour.

\zw{Something about pretrained embedding layer + training liwc embedding layer}
\zw{Something about models being too tightly trained on the training dataset to really generalise)}

\zw{Some concluding remarks}
While functionally this limits the vocabulary, there is also loss of information. Future work, could then employ both simple and complex mappings of different forms of words to single tokens that cohere with the LIWC dictionary, thus limiting information loss while retaining the predictive power.

\subsection{Limitations}
Although such lack of recognition can have positive effects, such as lower false positive rate, the politics of not being recognised, as argued by \citet{Benjamin:2019} are not straightforward and the lack of recognition does not provide a guarantee that systemic harm will not occur. For instance, if systems developed to detect abuse did not recognise Multi-cultural London English due to vocabulary reductions, any abuse that was written in that dialect would not be recognised, leaving those users in harms way. Given that LIWC was developed using ``dictionaries, thesauruses, questionnaires, and lists made by research assistants'' \citep{Tauscik:2010} in a North American context, it is highly unlikely that word forms that differ from mainstream usage were included. For instance, the commonly used `brotha' and `bruva' in North American and British contexts, respectively, are absent from the dictionary.
